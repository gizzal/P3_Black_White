1. Black-box Testing: 
a. In this phase the group will derive test cases from the program specification 
below. You should refrain from looking at the code as a source for test cases 
b. Model the input domain using the classification tree method
c. Document any exclusions or assumptions made 
d. Generate the following test suites: All single values, All pairs and All triples 
e. Identify the expected result for each test case
f. Run the test cases and identify whether the test passes (result matches the 
expected result) or not 
g. Measure the level of statement and branch coverage achieved by each suite
h. Measure the number of basis paths executed using McCabe IQ
